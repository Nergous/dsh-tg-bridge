# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Local images an answer embeds as `![caption](path)` are sent after it as
  photos with that caption (GIF, BMP and SVG, or a photo Telegram refuses, as
  files); the message text shows `🖼 caption` instead of the raw Markdown.
- `/new` in General without arguments shows the workspaces as buttons and
  then takes your next message (text, photo, file or voice) as the session's
  first prompt; "Start without a message", "Other workspace" and `/cancel`
  are available. `/new <workspace>` without a prompt asks for it the same way.
- The first prompt of a session started from Telegram is echoed at the top of
  its new topic.
- `/sessions` shows recent sessions as buttons: a session with a topic links
  to it, and a session without one gets a button that creates (or reopens)
  its topic and posts the link, so any DSH session can be continued from
  Telegram.
- Read reactions are back as an option: a delivered message gets 👀 (queued)
  or ⚡ (steer). Turn off with "React 👀 / ⚡ when a message is delivered".
- "Send answer.md above, characters" sets when an answer goes as a preview
  plus `answer.md` (default 3400); shorter answers that do not fit one
  message are split into several messages.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-22

### Changed

- Rewrite the project as a DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin. The Go bridge for
  the Codex App Server is removed; its last version stays at the
  `v0.1.5` tag.

### Added

- One Telegram forum topic per root DSH session, named
  `workspace · session title`, renamed when the title changes, closed on
  archive and reopened on restore. Subagents never create topics.
- Two-way mirroring: messages typed in DSH and agent output appear in the
  topic; text written in the topic is sent to the session through the same
  path as the DSH composer (queue, or steer with the `!` prefix).
- Live streaming of answers, collapsed tool-call blocks, one status line per
  subagent, turn-end notifications, delivery reactions, and a pinned status
  card per topic.
- Approvals and `ask_user_question` prompts with inline buttons that race the
  DSH GUI; the side that answers second is withdrawn.
- Topic commands `/stop`, `/status`, `/diff`, `/compact`, `/model`,
  `/verbosity`, `/mute`, `/unmute`, `/steer`, and General commands
  `/sessions`, `/workspaces`, `/new`.
- Photos, documents, and voice messages from Telegram as session input, with
  transcription through DSH speech-to-text or a configured command; files the
  agent presents are sent to the topic.
- Settings page in Plugins with token storage in DSH credentials, connection
  test, and `/bind` pairing of the forum group; a composer link to the
  session's topic.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Add resumable first-run pairing, per-user command installation, autostart,
  confirmed current-project registration, safe service startup, and
  no-argument current-directory opening.

### Fixed

- Use the installed per-user executable for autostart instead of retaining a
  temporary download path.
- Bound service readiness probes and recover stale startup locks after an
  interrupted launch.
- Retry interactive thread subscription while its newly created rollout file
  is still empty instead of stopping the bridge.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Show Telegram typing activity while Codex works and react to submitted
  prompts with processing, success, or failure status.

### Fixed

- Accept the current Codex App Server `thread/list` response shape while
  retaining compatibility with the legacy response.
- Queue burst App Server events without disconnecting the bridge while
  Telegram rendering catches up.
- Raise the App Server WebSocket message limit from the library default of
  32 KiB to 10 MiB for thread and turn payloads.
- Attach the Codex TUI to the current terminal instead of launching it with
  disconnected standard streams.
- Adopt threads created by the remote Codex TUI, persist their selected
  projects, and subscribe the Telegram bridge after the first turn creates the
  rollout.
- Replace stale persisted threads whose rollout no longer exists instead of
  failing `open` or service startup.
- Parse current nested Codex thread, turn, item, and delta events so Telegram
  receives TUI-originated responses.
- Avoid duplicating streamed assistant messages when Codex later emits the
  completed item.
- Report App Server WebSocket disconnects to the service instead of leaving a
  session indefinitely marked as running.
- Show App Server, IPC, project, and runtime details when `serve` starts, and
  include captured App Server diagnostics when the bridge exits unexpectedly.

### Documentation

- Document safe Windows path forms for Git Bash commands.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Accept boolean Telegram Bot API results for operations whose response body is
  intentionally ignored, allowing `setup` to complete after deleting a webhook.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Publish platform executables directly instead of wrapping them with README,
  LICENSE, and CHANGELOG in ZIP archives.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Updated project documentation and security policy to reflect the working
  beta application rather than its former skeleton stage.

### Fixed

- Made `/queue` list persisted FIFO prompts without consuming them.
- Made `/sessions` return recent persisted project sessions with its requested
  limit.
- Included the last locally opened project and thread in CLI status output.
- Rejected trailing JSON in configuration files.
- Added graceful `SIGTERM` handling for Linux services.
- Removed obsolete unwired-command scaffolding.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Linux amd64 support with Secret Service credential storage and systemd user
  autostart.
- Complete Go CLI bridge lifecycle for one authorized Telegram operator.
- Strict JSON configuration loading and validation for Telegram access, the
  loopback Codex App Server, and allow-listed project directories.
- Telegram bot token storage through Windows Credential Manager.
- Development and release automation with Task and GoReleaser.
- Security policy, implementation plan, and project documentation.
- Service lifecycle, local setup, recovery state, and Windows autostart.
- Operator configuration runbook and fake bridge integration coverage.
